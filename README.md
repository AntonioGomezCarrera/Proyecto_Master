### Simulink Criocooler Control Model
__Author : Antonio Gómez Carrera__
It is organise in Example and Model
- Example contains a simulink example of a house heating system. It was used to understand the functioning of simulink as well as the main functions.
- Model contains the crioocoler simulated.

## Model
It has a simulink pre-implemented PID which control an output intensity. This intensity flows through a resistor and by Joule Effect it heats the device. The heat transfer is modeled in the last step. It is also possible to change the criocooler temperature variations, changing amplitude, period and noise parameters.
